# Internet Freedom Nonprofit Seeks Rust Developer

February 13th, 2024

The Tor Project, Inc., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization advancing human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open source anonymity and privacy technologies, is seeking experienced Rust developers to be a part of the Network Team.

As a developer on the Network Team, you will be part of a small team that develops and maintains the networking software at the core of the Tor network, keeping it secure and improving it for the future. Over the past decade, we've been developing the Tor implementation in C, but the team is now migrating to Rust as part of our Arti project.

We are currently in the phase of preparing the release of Arti for client usage in 2024 -- this means our wider product portfolio, including the Tor Browser, will be moving to Arti as its Tor client implementation. Once client support has stabilized, the team will move towards implementing relay support in Arti such that we can begin the upgrade of the Tor network.

The team coordinates both synchronously and asynchronously via IRC, email, bug trackers, and some weekly audio/video meetings. A personal commitment to free and open source software, good communication and documentation skills, and passion for contributing to the greater good are all essential.

This is a full-time, remote position. Salary for this position will range from $100k to $110k USD (based on candidate experience) and there is voluntary opt-in salary transparency for employees and contractors. The organization is currently experimenting with a four day workweek.

## Summary

In this role, you will:

- Help design, develop, and improve Arti, our Rust implementation of the Tor protocol.
- Collaborate with other Tor teams to integrate Arti in their workflows.
- Contribute to other free, open-source Rust projects as needed, especially to ones that Arti depends on.

## Required Technical Skills and Experience

- Familiarity with the Rust programming language, and with system design in Rust.
- Strong remote work and time management skills.
- Good communication and documentation skills.
- Enthusiasm for teaching and learning within a distributed team.

## Preferred Qualifications

These are good to have, but not necessarily required.

- Familiarity with FOSS engineering practices.
- Experience doing code review of your coworkers' incoming code changes.
- Experience with async/await programming in Rust.
- Experience with portable, cross-platform coding. We work on Unix, macOS, Windows, iOS, and Android, and we're hoping to eventually expand to WASM.
- Experience with developing large software projects, keeping them maintainable and flexible over time.
- Experience with API design and documentation.
- Familiarity with privacy, network programming, distributed systems, security, and cryptography.
- Familiarity with C for reading reference C implementation of Tor's source code.
- Experience with reading and writing technical specifications.

Academic degrees are great, but not required if you have the right experience!

If you feel that you meet most of these requirements or could meet them with a little support, we would love to hear from you.
