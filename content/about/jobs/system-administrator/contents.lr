# Internet Freedom Nonprofit Seeks Systems Administrator

March 04, 2024

The Tor Project, Inc., a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization advancing
human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open
source anonymity and privacy technologies, is seeking a Systems Administrator to
be part of the Sysadmin Team.

The ideal candidate is resourceful, creative, and able to diagnose and
resolve problems quickly. You must have the patience to communicate
with a variety of interdisciplinary teams and users, including some
who are not technical and others who are extremely technical.

This Systems Administrator will work as part of a small team
responsible for managing the torproject.org servers, which, in turn,
allow the Tor Project to create the software we know and love.

Work is both synchronous and asynchronous, coordinated over GitLab
email, IRC, and some weekly audio/video meetings. A personal
commitment to free and open source software, good communication and
documentation skills, and passion for contributing to the greater good
are all essential.

This is a full-time, remote position. Salary for this position will
range from $80k to $90k USD (based on candidate experience) and
there is voluntary opt-in salary transparency for employees and
contractors. The organization is currently experimenting with a four
day workweek.
