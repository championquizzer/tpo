This developer will be tasked with improving the user experience and process of finding alternate routes to the Tor network when global censorship events block access to the Tor network. A personal commitment to free and open source software and the application of advanced programming skills for the greater good is essential.

This is a full-time remote position.

- Continue development of our bridge distribution system, rdsys.
- Maintain and improve the pipeline that distributes bridges to censored users.
- Evaluate and incorporate new pluggable transports.
- Collaborate with other teams in the Tor Project, external software projects (e.g. OONI), and research groups to move forward anti-censorship technology.

Required qualifications:

- Experience with designing, implementing, testing, and reviewing complex codebases (ideally in Go and Python).
- Ability to work in a self-directed and independent way.
- Comfortable with working remotely, across time zones.
- Strong familiarity with computer science fundamentals.
- Familiarity with Internet security and censorship circumvention technologies.

Preferred qualifications:

- Familiarity with reading research papers and turning research ideas into prototypes.
- Understanding of the Tor pluggable transport ecosystem and the censorship circumvention research space.
- Past contributions to and familiarity with the practices of free software projects.
- Passion and dedication to Internet freedom is an added plus.

To apply, submit a cover letter, your CV/resume (including three professional references), and a link to a code sample or some non-trivial software project you have significantly contributed to. In your cover letter, please include the reason you want to work at the Tor Project.

IMPORTANT: Please email application materials in plain text or PDF format, if possible, to job-anticensor at torproject dot org with “Anti-Censorship Developer” in the subject line.

Tor is for everyone, and we are actively working to build a team that represents people from all over the world — people from diverse ethnic, national, and cultural backgrounds – people from all walks of life. We encourage applications from BIPOC, non-cis people, women, and from people in any group that is underrepresented in tech.

The Tor Project's workforce is smart, committed, and hard working. We currently have a paid and contract staff of around 24 developers and operational support people, plus many thousands of volunteers who contribute to our work. The Tor Project is funded in part by government research and development grants, and in part by individual, foundation, and corporate donations.

Salary for this position depends on experience and there is voluntary opt-in salary transparency for employees and contractors.

The Tor Project has a competitive benefits package, including a generous PTO policy, 16 paid holidays per year (including the week between Christmas and New Year's, when the office is closed), and flexible work schedule. Insurance benefits vary by employment status and country of residence.

The Tor Project, Inc., is an equal opportunity, affirmative action employer.
