# Individual Giving Manager

April 2nd, 2024

The Tor Project, Inc. is a 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization advancing human
rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open source anonymity
and privacy technologies. Roughly a third of the organization's total revenue
comes from individuals, and more than 6,000 people make gifts under $1,000
every year.

Unlike some nonprofits that focus solely on donors who give at high levels, the
Tor Project has the unique opportunity to do something different â€” to amplify
the collective power of our small-dollar donors. We're looking for someone to
help us better connect and engage with this global base of supporters.

This is an excellent opportunity to take ownership of an underdeveloped program
and build it up from the ground.

  strategic efforts
