## Call for Applications: Board of Directors at The Tor Project

*August 17, 2022*

Note: this is not a paid position

### The Tor Project

The Tor Project is a U.S.-based 501(c)(3) whose mission is to advance human rights and freedoms by creating and deploying free and open source anonymity and privacy technologies, supporting their unrestricted availability and use, and furthering their scientific and popular understanding. The Tor Project is an essential player in the fight for Internet freedom. Human rights defenders and their organizations, journalists, whistleblowers, and activists depend on Tor to ensure their safety and security as they communicate online. We maintain the free, decentralized, open source privacy network known as Tor and the easy-to-use Tor Browser.

The Tor network and Tor Browser are used by millions of people every day, and they are the only tools that come with a holistic solution to address censorship circumvention and privacy protection at both browser and network levels. Our technology is recommended by Freedom of the Press Foundation, the Committee to Protect Journalists, and the Electronic Frontier Foundation for anybody targeted by surveillance or censorship. The New York Times, the BBC, ProPublica, Deutsche Welle, and Mada Masr use Tor to offer censorship-resistant versions of their websites.
