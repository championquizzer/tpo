description:

The Zcash Community Grants (ZCG) program funds independent teams entering the
Zcash ecosystem to perform major ongoing development (or other work) for the
public good of the Zcash ecosystem. ZCG currently supports a project to create
an implementation of the Tor protocols in Rust (called “Arti”).
