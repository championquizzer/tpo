### Cy Pres Awards – Consumer Privacy and Privacy Online

_Cy pres_ awards are funds distributed as a part of class action lawsuit settlements in the United States. When the totality of the funds cannot be distributed to class members, they can be distributed to nonprofit, advocacy, and research groups that generally represent the class members. Consumer privacy _cy pres_ awards can help the Tor Project to educate individuals and organizations about how to retain their privacy online, advocate for privacy protections, and build important free, open source technologies that prioritize privacy.
